## Tools for benchmarking Jekyll

This purpose of this repo is to hold tools that can be used to benchmark
Jekyll. Initially, it starts with a single script and a couple of
support files to generate test sites.

Currently planned features include the following:
 - More scripts or a framework to build more complex sites to use for
   different types of benchmarks.
 - A plugin that uses Jekyll's hooks to instrument how long certain
   operations take.
 - A set of tools that can be used to track Jekyll's performance over
   time, integrate with CI, and  provide status checks that integrate
   with GitHub in order to notify Jekyll's developers of performance
   regressions.
